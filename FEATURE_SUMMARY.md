# Death Notifications & Inheritance UI - Feature Summary

## Overview
Implemented a comprehensive death event system with real-time notifications and inheritance visualization for Dynasty Trader. This feature enhances the roguelike economy game by making character deaths more impactful and informative.

## Frontend Implementation

### Core Components
- **DeathNotification.tsx**: Animated death notification cards with market impact details
- **InheritanceModal.tsx**: Step-by-step inheritance flow visualization with wealth distribution
- **RecentDeathsPage.tsx**: Dynasty-wide death tracking with 7-day statistics
- **deathEventManager.tsx**: Intelligent service that differentiates user vs other player deaths

### Supporting Components  
- **useCharacterDeathListener.ts**: Hook for automatic data refresh after character deaths
- **formatting.ts**: Utility functions for currency formatting and relative time display

### Updated Components
- **WebSocketContext.tsx**: Enhanced to use death event manager instead of simple toasts
- **App.tsx**: Added `/deaths` route for recent deaths page
- **Layout.tsx**: Added deaths navigation link with skull icon
- **DashboardPage.tsx**: Integrated character death listener for data refresh

## Backend Fixes

### Database Schema Alignment
- **death.rs**: Fixed all SQL queries to use correct column names
  - `died_at` → `death_date`
  - `character_wealth` → `wealth_at_death`
  - Added proper age calculation using `EXTRACT(YEAR FROM AGE())`
  - Removed references to non-existent columns

- **death_service.rs**: Updated DeathEvent struct and INSERT queries
  - Aligned struct fields with actual database schema
  - Fixed INSERT statement to use correct column names

- **death_task.rs**: Updated logging to use correct field names

## Key Features

### Real-time Death Notifications
- WebSocket-based notifications for all character deaths
- Enhanced cards showing character details, cause of death, and market impact
- Auto-dismissing after 10 seconds with smooth animations

### Inheritance Flow Visualization
- Detailed modal for user's own character deaths
- Step-by-step animated presentation of wealth distribution
- Death tax calculation (10% of total wealth)
- Heir allocation display or dynasty treasury contribution
- Market impact visualization (affected regions, ghost listings)

### Recent Deaths Dashboard
- Track all deaths across dynasties in the past 7 days
- Statistics showing total deaths, wealth lost, and ghost listings created
- Real-time updates every 30 seconds
- Sortable death records with full details

### Market Impact Display
- Shows which regions are affected by wealthy character deaths
- Ghost listing counter from estate liquidation
- Market shock indicators for economic disruption

## Technical Improvements

### Dependencies Added
- **framer-motion**: For smooth modal animations and transitions
- **lucide-react**: For consistent death-themed iconography

### State Management
- Integrated with existing TanStack Query for server state
- Character death events trigger automatic data invalidation
- Selected character handling when character dies

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive error handling in death event manager
- Fallback to simple notifications if inheritance details fail
- Proper TypeScript type safety throughout

## API Integration

### Endpoints Used
- `GET /api/v2/deaths/recent`: Fetch recent deaths across dynasties
- `GET /api/v2/dynasties/:id/deaths`: Get dynasty-specific death statistics
- WebSocket `/ws/market`: Real-time death event notifications

### Data Flow
1. Character dies → Death event created in database
2. WebSocket broadcasts death event to all connected clients
3. Death event manager determines if it's user's character or other player
4. Appropriate UI displayed (inheritance modal vs notification)
5. Automatic data refresh triggered for affected components

## User Experience

### For User's Own Character Deaths
- Detailed inheritance modal with full wealth breakdown
- Clear visualization of death tax and heir distribution
- Market impact information showing economic consequences
- Animated step-by-step presentation for emotional impact

### For Other Players' Deaths
- Clean notification cards with essential information
- Market impact display for economic awareness
- Non-intrusive auto-dismissing design

### Recent Deaths Page
- Comprehensive view of all dynasty deaths
- Statistical overview for economic analysis
- Real-time updates for current information

## Performance Considerations

### Efficient Data Loading
- Recent deaths limited to 7 days to prevent large datasets
- Skeleton loading states for smooth UX
- Cached queries with automatic invalidation

### Memory Management
- Death notifications properly cleaned up after dismissal
- Modal components unmounted correctly
- WebSocket event listeners properly managed

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
- Dynasty relationship mapping for more accurate heir identification
- Death cause analysis and prevention tips
- Market prediction based on death patterns
- Memorial system for remembering fallen characters
- Death anniversary notifications

### Technical Debt
- Could extract common modal patterns into reusable components
- Death event manager could be split into smaller, more focused services
- More comprehensive error recovery strategies

## Testing Notes

### Manual Testing Completed
- ✅ Death notifications display correctly for other players
- ✅ Inheritance modal shows for user's own characters
- ✅ Recent deaths page loads and updates properly
- ✅ WebSocket integration works with real-time updates
- ✅ Database queries return correct data without errors
- ✅ All animations and transitions work smoothly

### Edge Cases Handled
- Characters without heirs (goes to dynasty treasury)
- Dead characters (proper filtering and handling)
- Network failures (graceful degradation)
- Missing character selection (proper fallbacks)

## Documentation Updates

### Updated Files
- **Frontend CHANGELOG.md**: Added v0.3.0 with comprehensive feature list
- **Main CHANGELOG.md**: Added death event system documentation
- **Frontend README.md**: Added death & inheritance features to feature list

This feature significantly enhances the Dynasty Trader experience by making character death a meaningful and well-visualized event that impacts both individual players and the broader game economy.
