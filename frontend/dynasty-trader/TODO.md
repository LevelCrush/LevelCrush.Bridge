## üêõ Known Issues to Fix

1. **Market Listings Display** ‚úÖ FIXED
   - ~~Currently showing item_id instead of item names~~
   - ~~Need to fetch and display actual item information~~
   - Fixed by joining with items table in backend

2. **Character Wealth Calculation** ‚úÖ FIXED
   - ~~Wealth is fetched separately from stats endpoint~~
   - Fixed calculation to multiply quantity √ó price

3. **Region Navigation**
   - No visual indication of character's current location
   - No travel time/cost displayed

4. **WebSocket Reconnection**
   - Could be more robust with exponential backoff
   - Need better error handling for connection failures

5. **Form Validation**
   - Limited validation on character/dynasty names
   - Need better error messages

6. **Aggressive Aging System** ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIALLY FIXED
   - ~~Characters are created with birth_date = NOW() (0 years old)~~
   - Characters now start at age 18
   - Aging task still runs every hour
   - Death probability needs adjustment for game balance
   - Current death rates: 0% (0-30), 0.1% (31-50), 1% (51-60), 5% (61-70), 15% (71-80)

## üìù Notes

### API Endpoints Needed
- `GET /api/v2/items` - List all items with details
- `GET /api/v2/characters/:id/inventory` - Character inventory
- `POST /api/v2/characters/:id/travel` - Travel between regions
- `GET /api/v2/market/transactions` - Transaction history
- `GET /api/v2/dynasties/:id/tree` - Family tree data

### Design Decisions
- Using item_id for now until item details endpoint exists
- Wealth calculation happens on backend for security
- WebSocket channels are region-specific to reduce data
- PWA focuses on offline reading, not offline trading

### Technical Debt
- Some components are getting large and should be split
- Need better error boundaries
- API service could use better typing
- Some duplicate code between pages

## üéØ Next Sprint Goals

1. **Character Inventory System** (Most requested feature)
2. **Item Details Display** (Fix the item_id issue)
3. **Purchase Flow Improvements** (Character selection, confirmation)
4. **Transaction History** (See past trades)
5. **Better Error Handling** (User-friendly error messages)

## üìÖ Timeline Estimates

- Character Inventory: 2-3 days
- Market Improvements: 3-4 days
- Dynasty Features: 2-3 days
