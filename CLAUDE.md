# Dynasty Trader (formerly Bridge) - Project Context

## Project Evolution

This project is evolving from "Bridge" (a multi-game inventory system) into **Dynasty Trader** - a revolutionary roguelike economy game where death drives markets and players build multi-generational trading empires.

## Current Status

**Phase**: Frontend Development Active! ðŸš€
**Backend**: Migration complete - PostgreSQL/TimescaleDB with all core systems
**Frontend**: React PWA live with authentication, dynasty management, character creation, and market trading
**Architecture**: Rust/Axum backend + React frontend + PostgreSQL/TimescaleDB
**Next Steps**: Polish UI, add real-time WebSocket updates, implement death mechanics in frontend

## Quick Start

```bash
# Backend setup
cp .env.dynasty .env
cargo run --bin migrate_postgres
cargo run --bin dynasty-trader

# Frontend setup (in another terminal)
cd frontend/dynasty-trader
npm install
npm run dev

# Visit http://localhost:5173 to play!
```

## Architecture Overview

### Current Stack (Bridge)
- **Backend**: Rust + Axum 0.7
- **Database**: MariaDB with SQLx
- **Auth**: Email/password with JWT
- **Features**: Inventory, trading, clans, marketplace

### Current Stack (Dynasty Trader)
- **Backend**: Rust + Axum 0.7 âœ…
- **Database**: PostgreSQL + TimescaleDB âœ…
- **Frontend**: React PWA with TypeScript âœ…
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom dark theme âœ…
- **State**: TanStack Query + Zustand âœ…
- **Auth**: JWT with persistent sessions âœ…
- **Real-time**: WebSockets (backend ready, frontend pending)
- **Discord**: Bot planned for next phase

## Core Game Concepts

### Dynasty System
- Each player controls a dynasty across generations
- Characters age and eventually die (permadeath)
- Inheritance passes wealth/reputation to heirs
- Death events affect market prices

### Market Mechanics
- Regional markets (no global auction house)
- Real-time price fluctuations
- Supply/demand driven by player actions
- Ghost markets for post-death influence

### Roguelike Elements
- Procedural market events
- Permadeath with inheritance
- Risk/reward on trade routes
- Character aging affects abilities

## API Evolution

### Existing Endpoints (Preserved)
All current Bridge endpoints remain functional during migration:
- `/api/v1/auth/*` - Authentication
- `/api/v1/users/*` - User management
- `/api/v1/inventory/*` - Inventory (adapting for characters)
- `/api/v1/trading/*` - Trading (enhancing for dynasties)
- `/api/v1/clans/*` - Clans (becoming dynasty alliances)

### New Endpoints (Dynasty Trader)
- `/api/v2/characters/*` - Character management
- `/api/v2/dynasties/*` - Dynasty operations
- `/api/v2/markets/*` - Regional market data
- `/api/v2/ghost/*` - Ghost market actions
- `/ws/market` - WebSocket market stream

## Database Schema (PostgreSQL)

### Core Tables
- **users**: Authentication and user accounts
- **dynasties**: Player dynasties with reputation and wealth tracking
- **characters**: Individual characters with full stats (health, stamina, charisma, intelligence, luck)
- **character_deaths**: Death records affecting markets

### Market Tables
- **regions**: 8 trading regions with safety/prosperity levels
- **items**: Tradeable goods with categories and rarity
- **market_listings**: Active trades in regional markets
- **market_prices**: TimescaleDB hypertable for price history
- **market_events**: Dynamic events affecting prices

### Seeded Data
- 8 regions: Capital City, Northern Mines, Eastern Port, etc.
- Each region has unique tax rates and characteristics
- Safety levels affect trade route danger
- Prosperity levels influence market activity

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Character aging mechanics
- Death and inheritance
- Market price calculations
- Dynasty progression

### Integration Tests
- Full character lifecycle
- Market event propagation
- WebSocket connections
- Discord bot commands

### Load Tests
- 10,000 concurrent traders
- Real-time market updates
- Death event processing
- Database performance

## Security Considerations

### New Attack Vectors
- Market manipulation via coordinated deaths
- Dynasty reputation exploits
- Ghost market abuse
- Time-based attacks on aging

### Mitigations
- Rate limiting on all actions
- Server-authoritative aging
- Cryptographic trade signatures
- Anti-bot behavioral analysis

## Backwards Compatibility

During migration, maintain full compatibility:
1. All Bridge APIs continue working
2. Gradual data migration
3. Feature flags for new systems
4. Dual-mode operation period

## Contributing

### For Bridge Features
Follow existing patterns in `src/`

### For Dynasty Trader Features
1. Read game design docs in `docs/game-design/`
2. Follow new patterns in character/dynasty modules
3. Ensure backwards compatibility
4. Add comprehensive tests

This project is transitioning from a multi-game inventory bridge to a groundbreaking roguelike economy game. The existing codebase provides an excellent foundation that we're building upon rather than replacing.
