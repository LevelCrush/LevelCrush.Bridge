# Dynasty Trader (formerly Bridge) - Project Context

## Project Evolution

This project is evolving from "Bridge" (a multi-game inventory system) into **Dynasty Trader** - a revolutionary roguelike economy game where death drives markets and players build multi-generational trading empires.

## Current Status

**Phase**: Frontend Development Active! ðŸš€
**Backend**: Migration complete - PostgreSQL/TimescaleDB with all core systems
**Frontend**: React PWA live with authentication, dynasty management, character creation, and market trading
**Architecture**: Rust/Axum backend + React frontend + PostgreSQL/TimescaleDB
**Next Steps**: Polish UI, add real-time WebSocket updates, implement death mechanics in frontend

## Quick Start

```bash
# Backend setup
cp .env.dynasty .env
cargo run --bin migrate_postgres
cargo run --bin dynasty-trader

# Frontend setup (in another terminal)
cd frontend/dynasty-trader
npm install
npm run dev

# Visit http://localhost:5173 to play!
```

## Architecture Overview

### Current Stack (Bridge)
- **Backend**: Rust + Axum 0.7
- **Database**: MariaDB with SQLx
- **Auth**: Email/password with JWT
- **Features**: Inventory, trading, clans, marketplace

### Current Stack (Dynasty Trader)
- **Backend**: Rust + Axum 0.7 âœ…
- **Database**: PostgreSQL + TimescaleDB âœ…
- **Frontend**: React PWA with TypeScript âœ…
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom dark theme âœ…
- **State**: TanStack Query + Zustand âœ…
- **Auth**: JWT with persistent sessions âœ…
- **Real-time**: WebSockets (backend ready, frontend pending)
- **Discord**: Bot planned for next phase

## Core Game Concepts

### Dynasty System
- Each player controls a dynasty across generations
- Characters age and eventually die (permadeath)
- Inheritance passes wealth/reputation to heirs
- Death events affect market prices

### Market Mechanics
- Regional markets (no global auction house)
- Real-time price fluctuations
- Supply/demand driven by player actions
- Ghost markets for post-death influence

### Roguelike Elements
- Procedural market events
- Permadeath with inheritance
- Risk/reward on trade routes
- Character aging affects abilities

### Legacy Bridge API (v1)
Still functional but deprecated - will be removed in future versions.

## Database Schema (PostgreSQL)

### Core Tables
- **users**: Authentication and user accounts
- **dynasties**: Player dynasties with reputation and wealth tracking
- **characters**: Individual characters with full stats (health, stamina, charisma, intelligence, luck)
- **character_deaths**: Death records affecting markets

### Market Tables
- **regions**: 8 trading regions with safety/prosperity levels
- **items**: Tradeable goods with categories and rarity
- **market_listings**: Active trades in regional markets
- **market_prices**: TimescaleDB hypertable for price history
- **market_events**: Dynamic events affecting prices

### Seeded Data
- 8 regions: Capital City, Northern Mines, Eastern Port, etc.
- Each region has unique tax rates and characteristics
- Safety levels affect trade route danger
- Prosperity levels influence market activity

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Character aging mechanics
- Death and inheritance
- Market price calculations
- Dynasty progression

### Integration Tests
- Full character lifecycle
- Market event propagation
- WebSocket connections
- Discord bot commands

### Load Tests
- 10,000 concurrent traders
- Real-time market updates
- Death event processing
- Database performance

## Security Considerations

### New Attack Vectors
- Market manipulation via coordinated deaths
- Dynasty reputation exploits
- Ghost market abuse
- Time-based attacks on aging

### Mitigations
- Rate limiting on all actions
- Server-authoritative aging
- Cryptographic trade signatures
- Anti-bot behavioral analysis

## Backwards Compatibility

During migration, maintain full compatibility:
1. All Bridge APIs continue working
2. Gradual data migration
3. Feature flags for new systems
4. Dual-mode operation period

## Contributing

### For Bridge Features
Follow existing patterns in `src/`

### For Dynasty Trader Features
1. Read game design docs in `docs/game-design/`
2. Follow new patterns in character/dynasty modules
3. Ensure backwards compatibility
4. Add comprehensive tests

This project is transitioning from a multi-game inventory bridge to a groundbreaking roguelike economy game. The existing codebase provides an excellent foundation that we're building upon rather than replacing.

## Known Issues & Recent Fixes

### Fixed Issues âœ…
- **Character wealth showing as NaN** - Fixed by aligning TypeScript interfaces with backend models
- **No regions available for trading** - Fixed by creating seed migration with 8 regions
- **Market stats showing NaN for average_transaction_value** - Fixed by updating MarketStats interface to match backend (removed non-existent field)
- **Double API path issue (/api/v2/api/v2/...)** - Fixed by removing /api/v2 prefix from service calls since ApiClient already includes it
- **Sellers showing as hashes** - Fixed by adding seller_character_name to market listings query
- **Character gold not displaying in purchase modal** - Fixed by using inheritance_received instead of wealth field
- **Purchase database constraint error** - Fixed by setting is_active=false instead of quantity=0 when all items purchased
- **Item names showing as hashes in purchase modal** - Fixed by using listing data instead of mock lookup
- **Characters without locations** - Fixed by defaulting new characters to Capital City and migrating existing characters

### Current Frontend Features
- JWT authentication with automatic token refresh
- Dynasty creation and management dashboard
- Character creation with randomized stats (health, stamina, charisma, intelligence, luck)
- Characters start with 500-1000 gold and begin in Capital City
- Character location display with map pin indicators
- Market browsing with 8 unique regions (Capital City, Northern Mines, etc.)
- Regional dropdown selection for easier navigation
- Item inventory management with sell functionality
- Transaction history with expandable details
- Real-time WebSocket updates for market changes
- Interactive price charts using Recharts
- Loading skeletons for smooth UX
- Death event toast notifications
- Market item detail modal with purchase flow
