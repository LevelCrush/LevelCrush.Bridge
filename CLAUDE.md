# Dynasty Trader (formerly Bridge) - Project Context

## Project Evolution

This project is evolving from "Bridge" (a multi-game inventory system) into **Dynasty Trader** - a revolutionary roguelike economy game where death drives markets and players build multi-generational trading empires.

## Current Status

**Phase**: Core Systems Implementation
**Completed**: 
- âœ… PostgreSQL + TimescaleDB setup
- âœ… Character lifecycle (birth, aging, death)
- âœ… Dynasty system with inheritance
- âœ… API v2 endpoints for Dynasty Trader
- âœ… Background tasks for aging and snapshots

**In Progress**:
- ðŸ”„ Market mechanics with TimescaleDB
- ðŸ”„ Death impact calculations
- ðŸ”„ Testing and documentation

**Next Steps**: See [Migration Plan](docs/game-design/synthesis/bridge-migration-plan.md)

## Quick Start

```bash
# Current Bridge setup (still works)
cp .env.example .env
cargo run --bin migrate
cargo run --bin bridge

# Dynasty Trader mode (NEW!)
cp .env.dynasty.example .env.dynasty  # See .env.dynasty for TimescaleDB config
cargo run --bin migrate_postgres       # Run PostgreSQL migrations
cargo run --bin dynasty_trader         # Start Dynasty Trader server
```

## Architecture Overview

### Current Stack (Bridge)
- **Backend**: Rust + Axum 0.7
- **Database**: MariaDB with SQLx
- **Auth**: Email/password with JWT
- **Features**: Inventory, trading, clans, marketplace

### Target Stack (Dynasty Trader)
- **Backend**: Rust + Axum (unchanged)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL + TimescaleDB (for time-series market data)
- **Frontend**: React PWA (Progressive Web App)
- **Discord**: Bot for notifications and trading
- **Real-time**: WebSockets for live market data
- **Auth**: Discord OAuth2 + existing system

## Core Game Concepts

### Dynasty System
- Each player controls a dynasty across generations
- Characters age and eventually die (permadeath)
- Inheritance passes wealth/reputation to heirs
- Death events affect market prices

### Market Mechanics
- Regional markets (no global auction house)
- Real-time price fluctuations
- Supply/demand driven by player actions
- Ghost markets for post-death influence

### Roguelike Elements
- Procedural market events
- Permadeath with inheritance
- Risk/reward on trade routes
- Character aging affects abilities

## Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: Database Migration (Week 1) âœ…
- [x] Migrate from MariaDB to PostgreSQL

### Phase 2: Core Mechanics (Week 2-3) âœ…
- [x] Character lifecycle (birth â†’ death)
- [x] Inheritance system
- [x] Death market impacts (partial)
- [ ] Basic ghost mechanics

### Phase 3: Market Systems (Week 4-5)
- [ ] Regional market separation
- [ ] Price history tracking
- [ ] WebSocket real-time updates
- [ ] Market event system

### Phase 4: Frontend (Week 6-8)

- [ ] OAuth2 integration
- [ ] Market alerts
- [ ] Death announcements
- [ ] Trading commands

## API Evolution

### Existing Endpoints (Preserved)
All current Bridge endpoints remain functional during migration:
- `/api/v1/auth/*` - Authentication
- `/api/v1/users/*` - User management
- `/api/v1/inventory/*` - Inventory (adapting for characters)
- `/api/v1/trading/*` - Trading (enhancing for dynasties)
- `/api/v1/clans/*` - Clans (becoming dynasty alliances)

### New Endpoints (Dynasty Trader)
- `/api/v2/characters/*` - Character management
- `/api/v2/dynasties/*` - Dynasty operations
- `/api/v2/markets/*` - Regional market data
- `/api/v2/ghost/*` - Ghost market actions
- `/ws/market` - WebSocket market stream

## Database Schema Changes

### New Tables
```sql
-- Character system
CREATE TABLE characters (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
    dynasty_id UUID REFERENCES dynasties(id),
    name VARCHAR(100),
    age INTEGER,
    health INTEGER,
    location_id UUID,
    died_at TIMESTAMPTZ,
    death_cause VARCHAR(255)
);

-- Dynasty system
CREATE TABLE dynasties (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
    name VARCHAR(100),
    generation INTEGER,
    reputation INTEGER,
    total_wealth DECIMAL(20,2)
);

-- Market time-series data
CREATE TABLE market_prices (
    time TIMESTAMPTZ,
    region_id UUID,
    item_id UUID,
    price DECIMAL(10,2),
    volume INTEGER
);
```

### Modified Tables
- `user_inventory` â†’ Add `character_id` column
- `clans` â†’ Adapt for dynasty alliances
- `trades` â†’ Add dynasty reputation effects

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Character aging mechanics
- Death and inheritance
- Market price calculations
- Dynasty progression

### Integration Tests
- Full character lifecycle
- Market event propagation
- WebSocket connections
- Discord bot commands

### Load Tests
- 10,000 concurrent traders
- Real-time market updates
- Death event processing
- Database performance

## Security Considerations

### New Attack Vectors
- Market manipulation via coordinated deaths
- Dynasty reputation exploits
- Ghost market abuse
- Time-based attacks on aging

### Mitigations
- Rate limiting on all actions
- Server-authoritative aging
- Cryptographic trade signatures
- Anti-bot behavioral analysis

## Backwards Compatibility

During migration, maintain full compatibility:
1. All Bridge APIs continue working
2. Gradual data migration
3. Feature flags for new systems
4. Dual-mode operation period

## Contributing

### For Bridge Features
Follow existing patterns in `src/`

### For Dynasty Trader Features
1. Read game design docs in `docs/game-design/`
2. Follow new patterns in character/dynasty modules
3. Ensure backwards compatibility
4. Add comprehensive tests

This project is transitioning from a multi-game inventory bridge to a groundbreaking roguelike economy game. The existing codebase provides an excellent foundation that we're building upon rather than replacing.
