# Roguelike Economy Hybrid - Final Recommendations

## Executive Summary

After extensive research into both roguelike and economy game design, the optimal approach is a **Dynasty Trading System** where players control generations of merchants within a persistent, player-driven economy. This creates a unique game where death is meaningful but not devastating, and economic empires span lifetimes.

## The Core Innovation: Generational Trading

### Why This Works
- **Solves the Persistence Problem**: Markets persist, characters don't
- **Creates Emotional Investment**: Your family legacy matters
- **Enables Long-term Strategy**: Plan across generations
- **Maintains Roguelike Tension**: Every journey could be your last
- **Generates Emergent Stories**: Multi-generational feuds and alliances

## Technology Stack (Updated for Hybrid)

### Backend: Rust + Axum
**Why it's perfect for this hybrid:**
- Handle thousands of concurrent trades and deaths
- Real-time market updates via WebSockets
- Memory safety crucial for economic calculations
- Fast enough for roguelike action elements
- Can share code between server and Tauri client

### Frontend: React + TypeScript + Zustand
**Optimized for hybrid needs:**
- Complex UI for trading and inventory management
- Real-time market visualization
- Character sheet and dynasty tree displays
- Zustand for simpler state management than Redux
- React Query for server state synchronization

### Desktop Client: Tauri
**Ideal for serious traders:**
- Native performance for complex market analysis
- Secure local storage of dynasty data
- Offline capability for planning
- Small download size (important for roguelike audience)
- Better anti-cheat potential

### Database Architecture
**Multi-tier approach:**
- **PostgreSQL**: Core game state, characters, items
- **TimescaleDB**: Market history and analytics
- **Redis**: Session data, real-time prices, death events
- **DynamoDB**: Cross-region dynasty data (if going global)

### Real-time Infrastructure
- **NATS**: Event streaming for market updates
- **WebRTC**: Direct player-to-player trading connections
- **CloudFlare Durable Objects**: Regional market instances

## Final Recommendation

Build the **Dynasty Trading System** with the recommended tech stack. Start with a tight core loop focused on the life/death/inheritance cycle with basic trading. The hybrid nature solves problems in both genres:

- Roguelikes often lack persistence → Dynasty system provides it
- Economy games often lack tension → Permadeath provides it
- Both benefit from emergent storytelling → Generational play delivers it

This is not just combining two genres - it's creating something genuinely new. The interplay between permadeath and persistent markets creates gameplay dynamics that haven't been seen before.

**The next step**: Build a 2-week prototype focusing solely on the death/inheritance/market-impact loop. If that feels compelling, everything else will follow.

Remember: **Great games create stories players want to tell. Every dynasty should be legendary.**
