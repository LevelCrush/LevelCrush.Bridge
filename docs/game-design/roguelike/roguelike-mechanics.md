# Roguelike Mechanics Deep Dive

## Core Pillars of Roguelike Design

### 1. Permadeath: The Ultimate Stakes
**Psychological Impact:**
- **Loss Aversion**: Every decision carries weight when death is permanent
- **Tension Amplification**: Heart-pounding moments when survival is uncertain
- **Meaningful Choices**: No save-scumming forces living with consequences
- **Emotional Investment**: Each run becomes a unique story
- **Relief and Triumph**: Surviving feels genuinely earned

**Design Considerations:**
- Death must feel fair, not cheap
- Player needs to understand why they died
- Quick restart is essential
- Death teaches valuable lessons

### 2. Procedural Generation: Infinite Replayability
**Content Generation:**
- **Level Layouts**: Never the same dungeon twice
- **Enemy Placement**: Unpredictable encounters
- **Loot Distribution**: RNG creates excitement
- **Event Sequences**: Different narrative beats
- **Environmental Hazards**: Varied challenges

**Benefits:**
- Prevents memorization and rote play
- Creates emergent situations
- Extends game longevity infinitely
- Reduces development burden
- Enables discovery and surprise

### 3. Run-Based Structure: The Core Loop
**Single Run Elements:**
- **Power Curve**: Start weak, become god-like
- **Resource Management**: Limited supplies create tension
- **Time Pressure**: Often implicit or explicit
- **Decision Points**: Fork-in-the-road moments
- **Climax and Resolution**: Boss fights or escape

**The Addiction Loop:**
1. Start run with hope and knowledge
2. Early game establishes momentum
3. Mid-game presents interesting decisions
4. Late game tests mastery
5. Death/Victory provides closure
6. "Just one more run" mentality

### 4. Knowledge as Progression
**Information Accumulation:**
- **Enemy Patterns**: Learn attack telegraphs
- **Item Synergies**: Discover powerful combos
- **Secret Locations**: Hidden rooms and paths
- **Optimal Strategies**: Resource efficiency
- **Risk Assessment**: When to push vs retreat

**Player Growth:**
- Skill improvement more important than stats
- Each death teaches something new
- Community knowledge sharing
- Wiki culture and discovery
- Mastery takes hundreds of hours

## Meta-Progression Systems

### Permanent Unlocks
**Types of Persistence:**
- **New Characters/Classes**: Variety in playstyles
- **Starting Items**: Small advantages
- **New Areas**: Expanded game world
- **Gameplay Modes**: Challenges and variants
- **Cosmetics**: Visual progression

**Balance Considerations:**
- Can't make game too easy
- Should add variety, not just power
- Unlocks create goals between runs
- Some players prefer no meta-progression

### Currency Between Runs
**Common Implementations:**
- **Partial Retention**: Keep 10% of gold on death
- **Special Currency**: Meta-currency earned through achievements
- **Banking Systems**: Deposit items for next run
- **Investment Returns**: Passive gains between runs
- **Legacy Items**: Rare items persist

### Character Development
**Skill Trees and Abilities:**
- **Talent Points**: Permanent character upgrades
- **Ability Unlocks**: New skills available in runs
- **Passive Bonuses**: Small stat increases

## Risk/Reward Mechanics

### The Greed Factor
**Pushing Your Luck:**
- **Cursed Items**: Powerful but dangerous
- **Devil Deals**: Trade health for power
- **Timed Rewards**: Rush for better loot
- **Elite Enemies**: Harder fights, better drops
- **Secret Levels**: High risk, high reward

### Resource Economics
**Managing Scarcity:**
- **Health as Currency**: Spending HP for gains
- **Limited Inventory**: What to carry?
- **Consumable Items**: When to use potions
- **Ammunition**: Every shot counts
- **Time as Resource**: Speed vs thoroughness
