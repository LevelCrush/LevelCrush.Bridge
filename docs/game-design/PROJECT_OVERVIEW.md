# Roguelike Economy Simulator - Complete Project Overview

## Project Evolution

This project began as an exploration of player-driven economy games and evolved into something much more ambitious: a revolutionary hybrid that merges roguelike permadeath with persistent economic systems.

## The Journey

### Phase 1: Economy Game Research
We analyzed what makes great economy games:
- Player agency and meaningful trades
- Supply/demand dynamics
- Information asymmetry
- Social trading systems
- Market manipulation and emergent gameplay

Key insights from games like EVE Online, Albion Online, and Star Wars Galaxies showed that the best economy games create player stories through economic interaction.

### Phase 2: Roguelike Deep Dive
We then explored roguelike design:
- Permadeath creating meaningful tension
- Procedural generation ensuring freshness
- Run-based structure and addiction loops
- Meta-progression respecting player time
- Knowledge as the ultimate progression

Games like Hades, Risk of Rain 2, and Slay the Spire demonstrated how roguelikes create compelling experiences through controlled loss and incremental mastery.

### Phase 3: The Synthesis
The breakthrough came in realizing these genres could enhance rather than compromise each other:
- **Problem**: Roguelikes lack persistence → **Solution**: Dynasty system
- **Problem**: Economy games lack tension → **Solution**: Permadeath consequences
- **Problem**: Both need engagement → **Solution**: Generational storytelling

## The Final Design

### Core Concept: Dynasty Trading
- Play as generations of merchants in a persistent economy
- Death transitions to your heir, not game over
- Your demise affects market prices and creates opportunities
- Build multi-generational trade empires
- Create stories that span real-world months

### Revolutionary Features
1. **Ghost Markets**: Trade from beyond the grave
2. **Temporal Echoes**: Past lives affect future markets
3. **Living Currency**: Money that evolves and dies
4. **Economic Spells**: Cast magic through market manipulation
5. **AI Market Personality**: The economy itself as a character

### Technical Architecture
- **Backend**: Rust/Axum for performance and safety
- **Frontend**: React/TypeScript for rich UI
- **Desktop**: Tauri for native performance
- **Database**: PostgreSQL + TimescaleDB for complex economic data
- **Real-time**: WebSockets and NATS for live markets

## Why This Matters

This design solves fundamental problems in both genres:

### For the Industry
- Shows how genres can truly merge, not just coexist
- Demonstrates persistence in permadeath games
- Proves economics can be core gameplay
- Creates new design patterns for others to follow

### For Players
- Every death tells a story
- Long-term goals without grinding
- Social connections that outlive characters
- Constant discovery through procedural economics
- Meaningful choices with lasting consequences

## Next Steps

1. **Prototype** (2 weeks): Core death/inheritance/market loop
2. **Vertical Slice** (2 months): One complete life cycle
3. **MVP** (6 months): Full dynasty system with basic economy
4. **Beta** (9 months): Community testing and balancing
5. **Launch** (12 months): Revolutionary new genre hybrid

## The Vision

Create a game where:
- A single trade can echo through generations
- Death is a comma, not a period
- Markets have memory and personality
- Every player's story interweaves with others
- Economic mastery takes a lifetime to achieve

This isn't just a game about trading or dying - it's about building something that outlasts you, creating legends that other players will tell, and participating in an economy that feels truly alive.

## Final Thoughts

This project represents a genuine innovation in game design. By deeply understanding what makes both genres compelling and finding their natural synergies, we've designed something that could define a new category of games.

The Dynasty Trading System isn't just a combination of two genres - it's a transformation of both into something greater. It takes the meaningful loss of roguelikes and the complex systems of economy games and creates an experience where every life matters and every trade echoes through time.
