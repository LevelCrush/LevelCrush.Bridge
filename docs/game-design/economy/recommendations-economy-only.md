## Game Design Recommendations

### Must-Have Features

1. **Local Markets Only**
   - No global auction house
   - Force players to travel/transport
   - Create arbitrage opportunities
   - Build regional economies

2. **Meaningful Specialization**
   - Deep skill trees that take months to master
   - Efficiency bonuses for specialists
   - Interdependency between professions
   - No "jack of all trades" builds

3. **Natural Scarcity**
   - Resources deplete and regenerate slowly
   - Geographic distribution of materials
   - Quality variations in resources
   - Time-gated production

4. **Risk/Reward Transport**
   - Valuable cargo attracts pirates
   - Safer routes take longer
   - Insurance systems
   - Escort services

5. **Information as Commodity**
   - No free market data everywhere
   - Players can sell information
   - Insider knowledge valuable
   - Communication has cost

### MVP Feature Set

**Phase 1 (Launch Critical)**
- Secure trading interface
- Basic inventory system
- Regional markets (3-5 regions)
- Simple crafting (10-20 items)
- Price history (last 24 hours)
- Basic reputation system

**Phase 2 (First Month)**
- Extended crafting trees
- Resource gathering
- Transport between regions
- Market analytics tools
- Player organizations

**Phase 3 (First Quarter)**
- Contracts and futures
- Advanced reputation
- Black markets
- Political systems
- API for third-party tools

## Technical Implementation Priority

### 1. Trading Engine (Weeks 1-4)
```rust
// Critical: Rock-solid trade execution
- Atomic transactions
- Rollback capability  
- Audit logging
- Rate limiting
- Exploit prevention
```

### 2. Market Data Service (Weeks 5-8)
```rust
// Real-time price feeds
- WebSocket streams
- Historical data API
- Aggregation service
- Chart data endpoints
```

### 3. Inventory System (Weeks 9-12)
```rust
// Flexible item management
- Weight/volume limits
- Item degradation
- Secure transfers
- Batch operations
```

## Critical Success Factors

### Technical Excellence
1. **Performance**: <100ms trade execution
2. **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime for trading
3. **Security**: No item duplication exploits
4. **Scalability**: Handle 10K concurrent traders

### Game Design Excellence
1. **Easy to Learn**: 5-minute tutorial gets you trading
2. **Hard to Master**: Months to learn optimal strategies
3. **Meaningful Choices**: Every decision matters
4. **Emergent Gameplay**: Unexpected strategies arise

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### Technical Pitfalls
- ❌ Using REST for real-time data (use WebSockets)
- ❌ Single database for everything (separate OLTP/OLAP)
- ❌ No event sourcing (lose audit trail)
- ❌ Tight coupling between services
- ❌ No rate limiting from day one

### Design Pitfalls
- ❌ Global auction house (kills gameplay)
- ❌ NPC price controls (removes agency)
- ❌ Infinite storage (removes logistics)
- ❌ No specialization benefits (boring)
- ❌ Perfect information (no discovery)

## Development Team Recommendations

### Core Team (Minimum)
- **Backend Engineer**: Rust expert for trading engine
- **Frontend Engineer**: React expert for UI
- **Game Designer**: Economy balancing experience
- **DevOps Engineer**: Infrastructure and monitoring
- **QA Engineer**: Exploit/security testing

### Extended Team
- **Data Analyst**: Economic monitoring
- **UI/UX Designer**: Trading interface expert
- **Community Manager**: Player liaison
- **Economy Designer**: Balance specialist

## Budget Considerations

### Infrastructure Costs (Monthly)
- **Development**: ~$500 (small team)
- **Beta**: ~$2,000 (1K players)
- **Launch**: ~$5,000 (10K players)
- **Scale**: +$500 per 1K players

### Development Time
- **MVP**: 3-4 months
- **Beta**: 6 months
- **Launch**: 9-12 months
- **Post-Launch**: Ongoing

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Exploits**: Extensive testing, bug bounties
- **Performance**: Load testing, gradual rollout
- **Downtime**: Hot failover, backup systems
- **Data Loss**: Event sourcing, frequent backups

### Game Design Risks
- **Economic Crash**: Emergency valves, resets
- **Monopolies**: Anti-trust mechanics
- **Botting**: Detection systems, captchas
- **RMT**: Clear policies, enforcement

## Competitive Advantages

1. **True Player Economy**: No NPC interference
2. **Risk/Reward Focus**: Meaningful consequences  
3. **Information Game**: Knowledge is power
4. **Technical Excellence**: Smooth, fast, reliable
5. **Community First**: Player-suggested features

## Next Steps

   - Performance tuning

## Final Recommendation

**Go with Rust/Axum/Tauri/React stack**. It provides the best balance of performance, developer experience, and future-proofing. Start with a laser focus on making trading perfect - if that's not fun, nothing else matters. Build the economy simulation on rock-solid technical foundations, then iterate on gameplay based on player behavior.

Remember: **The best economy games create stories**. Every trade should have the potential to be memorable.
