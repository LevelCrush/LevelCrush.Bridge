# Dynasty Trader Development Progress Summary

## Overview
We have successfully implemented the core systems for Dynasty Trader, transforming the Bridge codebase into a revolutionary roguelike economy game. All Phase 1-3 tasks from the roadmap have been completed.

## Completed Features

### ✅ Phase 1: Database Migration (Complete)
- [x] Migrated from MariaDB to PostgreSQL
- [x] Integrated TimescaleDB for time-series market data
- [x] Created character and dynasty tables with full lifecycle support
- [x] Implemented aging system with health degradation
- [x] Set up proper SQLx migrations with safety features

### ✅ Phase 2: Core Mechanics (Complete)
- [x] Character lifecycle system (birth → aging → death)
- [x] Dynasty inheritance system with 10% death tax
- [x] Death market impacts based on character wealth
- [x] Ghost market mechanics for deceased character inventories
- [x] Background tasks for aging and natural deaths

### ✅ Phase 3: Market Systems (Complete)
- [x] Regional market separation with 8 unique regions
- [x] Price history tracking with TimescaleDB
- [x] WebSocket real-time updates for market events
- [x] Market event system affecting regional prices
- [x] Trade routes between regions with distance and danger
- [x] Market listings with expiration and ghost pricing

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
- **Backend**: Rust + Axum 0.7 (unchanged from Bridge)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 15 + TimescaleDB
- **Real-time**: WebSockets with channel subscriptions
- **Background Tasks**: Tokio-based periodic tasks

### Key Services
1. **CharacterService**: Manages character creation, aging, and stats
2. **DynastyService**: Handles dynasty management and inheritance
3. **MarketService**: Regional markets, listings, and transactions
4. **DeathService**: Death processing and market impacts

### Database Schema
- 15+ tables including characters, dynasties, markets, and events
- TimescaleDB hypertables for market_prices
- Continuous aggregates for hourly and daily market stats
- Comprehensive indexes for query performance

### API Endpoints (v2)
- Dynasty management: `/api/v2/dynasties/*`
- Character operations: `/api/v2/characters/*`
- Market trading: `/api/v2/market/*`
- Death statistics: `/api/v2/deaths/*`
- WebSocket: `/ws/market`

## Testing Coverage
- Unit tests for all market models and operations
- WebSocket message serialization tests
- Integration tests for full dynasty lifecycle
- GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline with PostgreSQL service

## Migration Safety
- Idempotent migrations with IF NOT EXISTS patterns
- Migration tracking table for SQLx compatibility
- Automated migration script with error handling
- Comprehensive migration documentation

## Performance Optimizations
- TimescaleDB compression for historical data
- Continuous aggregates for market statistics
- Efficient indexes on all foreign keys
- Background task scheduling to prevent overload

### ✅ Phase 4: Frontend Development (Complete)
- [x] React PWA setup with TypeScript and Vite
- [x] JWT authentication with automatic token refresh
- [x] Dynasty creation and management dashboard
- [x] Character creation with randomized stats
- [x] Market trading interface with 8 regional markets
- [x] Real-time WebSocket integration
- [x] Death notifications and inheritance UI
- [x] Market analytics with technical indicators
- [x] Character inventory management
- [x] Transaction history with advanced filtering
- [x] Character statistics display with radar charts
- [x] Marketplace location awareness
- [x] Mobile-responsive design
- [x] PWA manifest and service worker

### Frontend Features Implemented
- **Authentication**: Login/register with form validation
- **Dynasty System**: Create and view dynasty statistics
- **Character Management**: Full CRUD with stats tracking
- **Market Trading**: Buy/sell with real-time updates
- **Inventory System**: Search, filter, sort, and sell items
- **Death System**: Notifications and inheritance flow
- **Analytics**: Market charts with SMA, EMA, RSI, Bollinger Bands
- **Location System**: Travel between regions, location-aware trading
- **Transaction History**: Complete audit trail with statistics
- **Character Stats**: Multi-tab interface with life progression

## Next Steps

### Phase 5: Discord Bot (Upcoming)
- [ ] OAuth2 integration with existing auth
- [ ] Market alert notifications
- [ ] Death announcements in channels
- [ ] Trading commands via Discord
- [ ] Dynasty leaderboards

### Phase 6: Polish & Launch
- [ ] Trade route visualization on map
- [ ] Character relationships and alliances
- [ ] Ghost character interactions
- [ ] Caravan management system
- [ ] Achievement and perk displays
- [ ] Regional reputation tracking

## Backward Compatibility
- Original Bridge API remains at `/api/v1/*`
- Database tables coexist without conflicts
- Authentication system shared between versions
- Gradual migration path for existing users

This represents a solid foundation for Dynasty Trader. The core game mechanics are fully implemented and tested, ready for frontend development and player interaction.
